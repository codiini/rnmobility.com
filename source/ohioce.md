Each state needs a competent medical workforce to meet the needs of its citizens. However, the requirements for some health care professions are not the same in each state. That is why it is important to find out what is required of you as a future or current registered nurse before moving across state lines. Contact information is located at the bottom of this page.

#### Endorsements

- Application fee ($75)

- All applications are to be completed online through the State of Ohio [eLicense system.](https://elicense.ohio.gov/OH_CommunitiesLogin)

- [Criminal records check](https://nursing.ohio.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/CRC_Process.pdf)

- Proof of English proficiency if you were educated abroad and a [CGFNS Professional Report](https://www.cgfns.org/services/credentials-evaluation/credentials-evaluation-service-professional-report/)

RN renewal takes place every two years during odd numbered years. License expiration dates have recently changed to October 31 due to a change in Ohio state law.

#### Continuing Education

You will need to complete at least 24 contact hours and at least one must be from [Category A](https://codes.ohio.gov/ohio-administrative-code/rule-4723-14-03). If your endorsement will cause you to have less than 12 months of practice by the time of your renewal, you will only need 12 contact hours.
