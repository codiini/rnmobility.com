    <p>
      Finding information on transferring, renewing, or meeting continuing education requirements for your nursing
      license should be simple. Unfortunately, many state websites make it hard to locate, so we've organized this
      information uniformly, with links to primary sources for easy verification. You can also find a way to earn CE
      credit at the bottom of each page.
