        The Nursing Licensure Compact: The key to your mobility throughout {{ compact_states_count }} states
      </h3>

      <p style="font-size: 18px;">
        One of the benefits of being a Registered Nurse is that you have a skill set that is in demand everywhere in the
        US. This gives you the freedom of mobility; however, moving from one state to another can involve a lot of
        paperwork and can be costly. The Nurse Licensure Compact (NLC) was established to increase nurse's mobility.

        <h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Remote States</h3>
        <p>
          The NLC allows nurses to work in remote states. Remote states are states that are not your primary state of
          residence. Your primary state of residence is the state you live in and claim for legal purposes. If your
          primary state of residence is a compact state and you were granted a multi-state license, you can work in
          remote states. <a href="https://www.nursys.com" target="_blank">Click here</a> to see if you have a
          multi-state license.

        <h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Less Paperwork</h3>
        <p>
          How does this impact you? Consider the following example. Suppose your primary state of residence is Maryland,
          a compact state, and you work as a nurse in Delaware, also a compact state. You will not have to apply for
          endorsement of your license in order to work in Delaware. This helps you save money and causes fewer
          documentation requirements.

      <h3 style="font-weight: bold;" class="section-three__text--heading mb-4">Exceptions</h3>
      <p style="font-size: 18px;">
        You will have to apply for endorsement and pay applicable fees if you change your primary state of residence.
        When you move, you will have 30 days to practice on your former license (beginning employment start date). If
        your employment start date occurs before you change your primary state of residence, you have 30 days from the
        day you have established residence (receiving a drivers license, for example).
