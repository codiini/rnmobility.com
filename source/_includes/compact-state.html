    Nursing Licensure Compact (NLC) is an agreement between states that allows nurses to have one license but the
    ability to practice in other states that are part of the agreement.
  </p>
  <p>
    Originally developed in 2000, in {{ 'now' | date: '%Y' }} the license has grown to include
    {{ compact_states_count }} states. To help streamline the process for nurses the Enhanced Nursing Licensure Compact
    (eNLC) was implemented in 2018 and included standards for licensure which the original compact license was lacking.
